## Technical Description

### Data Wrangling
After retrieving data from the API, We need to **reshape** our data so that it can be readale to our users. For example, after we get the exchange rates of different cryptocurrencies, we will _separate them into different dataframes_ and _calculate summary information_ about each type of cryptocurrency. We will also **visualize** the data so that our users can easily see the trends of different cryptocurrencies. For exchange rate of one specific cryptocurrency, we will _compare its current rate to its historic rate_ and _generate a line plot_.
